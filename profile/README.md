<!-- Introduction -->
<p>
  <em>This organization is mainly some <strong>course codes written by <a href="https://github.com/HELLORPG">Ruopeng Gao</a></strong> during the studying in Nanjing University. Most of them are coursework for Computer Science courses during the undergraduate period.</em>
</p>

<!-- Warning -->
<p>
  <h3>:bangbang: DO NOT Plagiarize :bangbang:</h3>
  When you cannot understand the design of some experiments, you can refer to the existing code to understand. But <strong>DO NOT</strong> just copy other people's (include this organization's) code.
